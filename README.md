## The Context
A global, New Delhi-based retail company, PhoenixARM Technologies, has decided to expand its operations to new regions and aims to optimize its customer engagement strategies. Based on their existing success rates in existing regions, they have developed four distinct anonymized (which is rather ironic) customer personas that guide targeted marketing efforts

Akshat, Bhavesh, Chaitanya, Darsh

Our task is to assist the marketing team by predicting the persona group for 2,627 prospective customers in the new regions, enabling the company to tailor its outreach and maximize impact.

## Dataset Details
The dataset contains records for 5,647 individuals, with 12 key features that include:

ID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Sex: Gender of the customer.

Bachelor: Indicates the marital status of the customer.

Age: Customer's age.

Graduated: Whether the customer has completed their graduation.

Career: Occupation type of the customer.

Work Experience: Total years of work experience.

Family Expenses: Monthly family expenditure categorized as Low, Average, or High.

Family Size: Number of family members.

Variable: A categorical feature representing other characteristics.

Segmentation: Persona assigned in the existing market (target variable).

Description: Additional insights about the customer.

The anonymized segmentation column (Akshat, Bhavesh, Chaitanya, Darsh) serves as the target variable.
